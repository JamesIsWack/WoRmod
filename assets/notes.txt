qb.pab file recompile ideas:
  recompile scripts with QBc/NodeROQ, then rebuild using GH3-Toolkit and finialize with Onyxite Command Line. decrypt from EDAT to make usable on the game.
new ui for switching between instruments while in Quickplay+:
  find ui script that handles swapping instruments, make new ui option in pause menu for it.

scripts/guitar/debug_menu_data.qb | used for most of the logic/QS for debug_menu

script calls most funcs from guitar/debug_menu_funcs.qb, check there for logic.

SectionInteger debug_use_screen_noise 1
SectionInteger debug_use_motion_blur 1

set these to 0 to disable the WoR specific screen effects.
other debug SectionIntegers are also present in this file, could be used for some basic setting for WoRmod
